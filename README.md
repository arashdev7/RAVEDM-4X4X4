# RAVEDM 4X4X4 

_RAVEDM or Rgb Audio Visualizing Electro Dancable Music 4x4x4_ (I tried my best to fit it into the title.
It is a 4x4x4 Green LED cube as of now(I couldn't make RGB possible as of now due to the high price ofdata transfer LEDS,
and my inability to control 28 (8 for each color and 4 for ground)  pins with PWM. Even MEGA has 12 PWMs as far as I can remember(fact check this), I would require 2 Megas ans one Arduino atleast 
or some other solution. I will explain my project below.

## Components

- 4× 4-bit shift registers to have individual control of each LED seperately
- 64 LEDS(any color) and a lot more that will be sacrificed in the process
- I used Galvanised Iron for the 16 Rods on which the LEDS go,recommendef by a friend,
  there might me better options available online
- A solder and flux woulda absolutely necessary, I made the whole ground base for the 4 with the solder and attatched the r and the b of the rgb LEDS(I thought I had bought the data transfer LEDS,(past me should have seen the code first)
- I used an acrylic base and an acrylic box to store your circuit.
- A breadboard and wires( a circuit mode can also be used to save space and to make it look asthetically cooler)
